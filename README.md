#Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
1. Aim and Scenario Definition
Application: AI-powered Chatbot
Purpose: To provide customer support for a company's e-commerce platform, handling common inquiries, 
tracking orders, and offering personalized product recommendations.
Target Audience: Online shoppers of diverse age groups and tech-savviness levels, seeking quick and accurate 
support.
Objectives:
• Enhance user engagement with quick response times and helpful answers.
• Improve self-service efficiency to reduce reliance on human agents.
• Offer personalized experiences based on browsing history and preferences.
2. Design Aspects and Associated Prompt Patterns
Idea Generation Prompts
Objective: Brainstorm innovative chatbot features to meet key objectives like engagement and self-service 
efficiency.
• Prompt: "What unique features could improve the chatbot’s self-service capabilities and provide 
relevant answers without human intervention?"
• Examples: Conversational shortcuts for common inquiries, a visual menu for quick navigation, 
integration with order tracking systems, and product recommendation engines.
Persona and Context Prompts
Objective: Define the chatbot’s tone and style to create a friendly, helpful experience aligning with user 
expectations.
• Prompt: "What tone should the chatbot adopt to resonate with users, from young adults to seniors, while 
being efficient and clear?"
• Examples: A friendly, conversational tone for most responses, with a formal style for order issues and 
privacy-related queries.
Exploratory Prompts
Objective: Investigate user needs and technical requirements for seamless interaction.
• Prompt: "What are the most frequent customer inquiries, and how could the chatbot address these 
effectively?"
• Examples: Analyzing customer data to identify high-frequency questions, such as order status, return 
policies, and product recommendations, then designing responses accordingly.
Refinement Prompts
Objective: Refine design elements to ensure chatbot responses are clear, relevant, and personalized.
• Prompt: "How can the chatbot's responses be tailored based on user data without compromising 
privacy?"
• Examples: Use anonymized browsing and purchase history to suggest relevant products while allowing 
users to opt out of personalized recommendations.
Scenario Testing Prompts
Objective: Simulate realistic user interactions to test the chatbot’s responsiveness and adaptability.
• Prompt: "Imagine a user inquiring about a delayed order, showing frustration. How should the chatbot 
handle this?"
• Examples: Craft responses to acknowledge the delay, apologize, offer a status update, and escalate to a 
human agent if needed.
Error Handling Prompts
Objective: Anticipate issues and develop prompts to handle them gracefully.
• Prompt: "What should the chatbot do if it doesn’t understand a user’s question or can’t find relevant 
information?"
• Examples: Program responses like, “I’m here to help, but I’m not sure I understood. Could you rephrase 
that?” and offer options to connect to a live agent.
3. Implementation Plan
Steps to Build and Implement the Chatbot
1. Define System Requirements: Choose NLP models, data sources, and define integrations with the 
company’s databases for order tracking and product inventory.
2. Select Components and Configure Systems: Set up API integrations, user interfaces, and the chatbot 
framework.
3. Develop User Interaction Scripts: Based on prompts, script responses and decision trees for common 
user interactions.
4. Testing and Deployment: Run scenario tests, refine based on user feedback, and deploy to a staging 
environment before live implementation.
5. Integration: Integrate with the e-commerce platform’s customer support workflows.
4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection 
Feedback Prompts
• "What do users think about the chatbot’s ability to answer their questions quickly and accurately?"
• "Is the tone and style of the chatbot appropriate and effective?"
Feedback Collection: Conduct surveys, gather chat logs, and monitor support metrics (e.g., response times, 
resolution rates). Use findings to adjust responses, add features, or modify the chatbot’s tone.
5. Documentation of Findings
Summary of Prompt Patterns and Their Impact
• Idea Generation helped uncover the need for conversational shortcuts and visual menus, enhancing user 
experience.
• Persona and Context Prompts ensured a tone that resonated well with diverse users, enhancing 
satisfaction.
• Scenario Testing identified areas where the chatbot needed improvements in handling complex queries, 
leading to more robust responses.
6. Deliverables
1. Detailed Report: Covers aims, background, audience needs, objectives, and prompt patterns with 
examples.
2. Chatbot Prototype: A functional chatbot with core features tested and ready for initial deployment.
3. Prompt Effectiveness Summary: Analysis of how each prompt pattern shaped the chatbot’s design, 
including recommendations for future refinement.
4. User Testing and Improvement Plan: Testing results, feedback insights, and a prioritized improvement 
plan based on user interactions.
This structured approach not only applies diverse prompting techniques but also iterates the chatbot’s design in a 
way that focuses on both functionality and user experience. Each stage refines the design, ensuring alignment 
with the objectives and enhancing the final product.
